# My Current Work
My current work focuses on Computer Vision (CV) through deep learning. I am in the midst of working on projects that explore tasks like image classification and object-detection, and generative modeling.

I am currently using my background in architecture and design as the primary application, but trying to fan out to other spatial applications, such as deforestation detection in the Amazon rainforest. 

Within architecture, I have been using the RPLAN dataset put together by [Wenming Wu, et. al.](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~fuxm/projects/DeepLayout/index.html) who were kind enough to let me access it for learning purposes. The dataset contains 80,000+ apartment floor plans, and I plan to use it to learn image processing, generative modeling, and room detection.

My current projects are:
- [Image Classification]() (MNIST, Amazon Dataset, and RPLAN)
- [Image Generation through GANs]() (MNIST, and RPLAN)
	- Simple GAN
	- Conditional GAN
	- Wasserstein-loss GAN
	- Deep Convolutional GAN
	- Pix2Pix
	- CycleGAN
	- StyleGAN

# My Journey into Computer Vision

## My Pivot from Architecture
After being in the architecture industry for a couple years, I started feeling uneasy to continue the career trajectory I had so confidentaly planned for myself. I was coming to some difficult realizations: much of my work as an architect can be automized, and architecture by itself may not allow room for working on larger-scale social issues that I deeply care about.

I also noticed that many people in the discipline had started to share similar beliefs. People within architecture started to incorporate ideas from parallel fields such as law, economics, social justice, and technology to supplement architecture and try to increase its impact.

People like my professor, [Gabriel Cuellar](https://cadaster.us/) researched approaches to architecture with the socio-economic and legal environments of the region into mind. Others like [Stanislas Chaillou](http://stanislaschaillou.com/articles.html), an architect with a keen interest in the latest technologies, explored the intersection of architecture and artificial intelligence by proposing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate architectural floor plans.

Given the challenges of the 21st century, and traditional architecture's lack of resources to address these challenges, I decided to reimagine my career. I planned on investing time learning a diverse set of tools that could be versatile enough to work on multiple complex problems, and I concluded that AI and Data Science could provide just that. I recognized just how powerful tools like machine learning and deep neural networks are, and I believe that these technologies have started to serve a cruicial role in addressing a vast array of issues.

## My Introduction to Computer Science and Machine Learning
Since I do not come from a Computer Science (CS) background, I decided to first ease myself into this vast discipline with the following online resources:

- Parts of University of Michigan's EECS 203 - Discrete Math
- Applied Math section of the [Deep Learning Book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)  by Ian Goodfellow, et. al.
-  University of Birmingham's notes on [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~jxb/DSA/dsa.pdf)
- 3Blue1Brown's playlist on [Linear Algebra and Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw)
- [The Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/share/1013gG2@PkdgfUtjc1QOe0ZHBXtxRhRtY1c=/)
- [Python For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)

These resources helped introduce me to fundamentals of computational math, web development, and coding. Simultaneously, I started familiarizing myself with machine learning by following these online courses:
- [Machine Learning, Data Science and Deep Learning with Python ](https://www.udemy.com/share/101W9O2@FG1jVGFgcFQOe0ZHBXtxRhRuSldhYHM=/)
- [Fast.ai: Practical Deep Learning for Coders ](https://course.fast.ai/)
- [PyTorch for Deep Learning with Python](https://www.udemy.com/share/101rrK2@PW5gV2JbSl0OdkFLBHBOfRRt/)

## My Introduction to Computer Vision
After beginning to have a fundamental understanding of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and PyTorch, I wanted to pick a specific topic within deep learning to kickstart my pivot. Because of my visual background, and my interests in design automation, I decided to go deeper into Computer Vision (CV). To get started, I used the University of Michigan's [EECS 598 - Deep Learning for Computer Vision](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/FA2020/) course as my guide. This course was similarly structured to [Stanford's CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/), but used PyTorch as the main library for assignments.

This was the most useful, yet challenging course I took, but it taught me fundamentals of CV topics like:

-   Convolutional networks
-   Recurrent networks
-   Attention and transformers
-   Object detection
-   Image segmentation
-   Video classification
-   Generative models (GANs, VAEs, autoregressive models)

After taking this course, I came to a better understanding of the works of people like Stanislas Chaillou from above. I realized Stanislas's work was built on top of a vast library of research that came before it, such as the research by [Weixin Huang and Hao Zheng](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328280126_Architectural_Drawings_Recognition_and_Generation_through_Machine_Learning), who used [Pix2Pix GAN](https://phillipi.github.io/pix2pix/) to generate apartment floor plans. Machine learning has started to push deeper into architecture, and I decided that I could leverage my background in architecture to start working on some applications. Since then, I have been focusing on getting more fundamental understanding of the math behing machine learning, image processing, and deployment.
